# Session Handoff

- Purpose: Restore context for the `codex/phase6` branch.
- Scope: beta 0.4.0 workflow configuration review follow-ups, local Codex package export, source/runtime separation, and runtime deletion independence.
- Audience: AI agents, maintainers
- Status: done
- Updated: 2026-05-01
- Related docs: [./state.json](./state.json), [../../work_backlog.md](../../work_backlog.md), [./backlog/2026-05-01.md](./backlog/2026-05-01.md)

- Branch: `codex/phase6`
- Updated: `2026-05-01`

## Current Focus

- TASK-045 runtime deletion independence is complete; `workflow-source/` development checks pass even when the applied `ai-workflow/` runtime layer is temporarily hidden.

## Key Changes

- Migrated prior active backlog records from `ai-workflow/project/` into branch-specific task files under `ai-workflow/memory/codex/phase6/backlog/tasks/`.
- Created branch-specific `state.json`, `session_handoff.md`, and daily backlog aggregate docs for `codex/phase6`.
- Aligned active workflow paths in `WORKFLOW_INDEX.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `workflow-source/README.md`, and `work_backlog.md`.
- Preserved prior `gemini/phase6` history as imported main branch memory.
- Removed obsolete tracked `.ai-workflow-backups/` and `scratch/bootstrap_test/` artifacts.
- Registered beta 0.4.0 review findings as `TASK-042` subitems `WF-042-01` through `WF-042-05`, then added `WF-042-06` for parser/template alignment.
- Completed WF-042-02 by adding env-based branch fallback and unsafe branch slug filtering in `get_current_branch()`.
- Completed WF-042-01 by updating `build_state_cache_refresh_hint()` to use `workflow-source/scripts/generate_workflow_state.py` and `ai-workflow/memory/work_backlog.md`.
- Completed WF-042-06 by teaching `parse_handoff()` to read `Current Focus`/`Work Status` and `parse_backlog()` to follow linked task files under `backlog/tasks/`.
- Switched newly generated AI-facing handoff templates and handoff draft output to English-first schema.
- Completed WF-042-03 by changing `check_workflow_state_generator.py` to write generated state into a temporary file instead of tracked `gemini/phase6/state.json`.
- Completed WF-042-04 by defining daily backlog aggregates as tracked lightweight indexes and task files as the detailed source of truth.
- Completed WF-042-05 by updating `docs/CODE_INDEX.md` and `ai-workflow/memory/repository_assessment.md` for the `ai-workflow/` subdirectory layout.
- Generated the current Codex package at `dist/harnesses/codex/v0.4.0-beta/` with `standard-ai-workflow-codex-v0.4.0-beta.zip`.
- Dry-run checked direct self-application and confirmed it would replace `AGENTS.md` and the full `ai-workflow/` tree; root overwrite was skipped to preserve the source repository's branch-specific memory and development files.
- Moved workflow development source from `ai-workflow/` to `workflow-source/`.
- Kept `ai-workflow/` as the applied runtime/state layer with `WORKFLOW_INDEX.md`, `memory/`, runtime `README.md`, and minimal runtime `core/`.
- Updated source scripts/tests to import from `workflow-source` while preserving `ai-workflow/memory/` as the active state path.
- Updated `apply_harness_update.py --preserve-data` to overlay runtime files without deleting `ai-workflow/memory/` or `WORKFLOW_INDEX.md`.
- Updated `export_harness_package.py` so Codex packages include `bundle/ai-workflow/memory/PROJECT_PROFILE.md`.
- Updated read-only MCP registry/fixtures, scaffold smoke test, and SDK stdio smoke test for the `workflow-source/` source root.
- Re-exported the Codex v0.4.0-beta package and re-synced the applied runtime layer under `ai-workflow/`.
- Synced root `ai-workflow/memory/state.json` and `session_handoff.md` with current `codex/phase6` state to avoid stale default runtime state.
- Moved `phase5_governance_guide.md` into `workflow-source/core/` so package export source docs no longer depend on `ai-workflow/memory/`.
- Added `check_source_without_runtime_layer.py`, which temporarily hides `ai-workflow/` and runs the core source development checks.
- Updated workflow state and handoff git tests to use `workflow-source/examples/acme_delivery_platform/` fixtures instead of active runtime memory docs.

## Next Actions

- [x] TASK-044 Separate workflow development source from applied runtime
- [x] TASK-043 Apply current Codex workflow package locally
- [x] WF-042-01 Align workflow state refresh hint paths

## Risks & Blockers

- No active blocker. Optional MCP SDK stdio verification passed in the repository `.venv` with `mcp==1.27.0`; system `python3` may still need `python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` before running that single SDK test.
