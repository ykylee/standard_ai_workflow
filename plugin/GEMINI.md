# Standard AI workflow — always-on rules (Gemini extension context)

## Working Principles

<!-- generated-from: core/global_workflow_standard.md §1 · §3 · §8 · §11 — do not edit this block directly; edit the standard document and regenerate. -->

- Start every session by reading the current state summary documents first.
- Before starting work, briefly state its purpose, scope, expected deliverables, and affected documents.
- Record work in the state documents; track progress as exactly one of `planned`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`.
- Never mark an unverified result as done.
- Before ending a session, summarize the current state so the next session can pick it up directly.
- Multiple agents may work together: sync with the remote before starting, check what other agents are doing, and pick work that does not overlap.
- Never decide irreversible actions alone — deleting or overwriting another agent's work requires confirmation from the user.
- Keep the shared standard thin; put project-specific differences in the project profile.

## Session Close Order

Close a session in the order **update memory → commit → push**. Do not split the memory update into a separate turn after the commit, so that pushed commits always carry the memory update with them (collaboration consistency).

- Update before closing: `state.json`, `session_handoff.md`, the latest backlog

## Memory Update Paths

- Restore session-start baseline: `wk session-start`
- Register / update a task: `wk backlog-update`
- Sync affected documents (advisory): `wk doc-sync`
- Regenerate state.json at session close: `wk refresh-state`
- Roll off handoff §1 baselines when over cap: `wk rollover-baselines`

- When the handoff's `in_progress` / `blocked` lists are empty, leave an **empty bullet `-`**. Prose there is parsed as a work item.
- Entries in the handoff's recently-completed list start with `TASK-` and never exceed 10.
- A backlog task's `status` is one of `planned` / `in_progress` / `blocked` / `done`.
- `state.json` is a **generated artifact** — never hand-edit it. The SSOT is `backlog/tasks/` plus `session_handoff.md`; regenerate with `wk refresh-state` at session close.
- Handoff §1 baseline lines have a cap. When it is exceeded, **move** the excess with `wk rollover-baselines` — never delete them by hand. That prose exists nowhere else, unlike the recently-done list whose SSOT is `backlog/tasks/`.
- `session_handoff.md` and the backlog are **inputs to the state.json generator** — writing outside the format silently corrupts state.json.
