# Bug Report Context:
# - Bug Report: State JSON Task Mismatch

-- Description
The `state.json` file does not automatically update its `done_items` count when a task is manually marked as done in the backlog file.

-- Expected Behavior
When `status: done` is added to a task in the backlog, the `task_count` or `done_items` in `state.json` should reflect this change after the next sync.

-- Actual Behavior
`state.json` remains stale until a full manual update is triggered.

-- Steps to Reproduce
1. Modify `ai-workflow/project/backlog/2026-04-27.md` and set a task to `done`.
2. Check `ai-workflow/project/state.json`.
3. Observe that `done_items` list does not contain the task ID.
